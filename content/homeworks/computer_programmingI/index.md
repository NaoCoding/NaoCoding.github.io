# 2023-NTNU-CP1 Code

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/NaoCoding/NTNU_CP1_Code)

```
This repository is all about CP1(Computer Programming 1 aka 程設一),
which is the course for freshman to learn how to program in C from NTNU.
All of the code are published after the semester was ended,
so don't afraid about cheating issues.(However, it is forbidden to use my code in future's CP1).

Thanks all TAs and neokent for giving us a fun and memorable course.

There are five homework and two online exam during CP1 in 2023 Fall Semester.
And below are my scores, questions which I didn't get full score should not
consider my file as best/good answer. Some homeworks were fun or special,
such as diceroller in hw3, I made a gtk user interface.

Hw1 : 20 20 15 20 18 5, sum : 98/105

Hw2 : 20 18 20 18 18 5, sum : 99/105

Hw3 : 14 17 20 20 20 0 0 (forgot to upload bonus....) , sum : 91/110

Midterm : 20 20 13 8 12 5, sum : 78/105

Hw4 : 20 20 20 19 16.9 5, sum : 100.9/105

Hw5 : 17 16 16 20 20 5, sum : 94/105

Final : 8 13 5 50(52, but max was 50) 5, sum : 81/105

Final Score : 102.78(92.78 original) (A+)

Another good example from my classmate, Darrin Lin
He also got A+ in CP1 course, it is recommended to watch his example.
