Please explain your answer.\nAnswer #\rAccording to the padd() function in the picture, we can see that it will keep attaching the highest exponents which hasn\u0026rsquo;t been attached between $a(x)$ and $b(x)$. We can see the switch 0 : It will attach both $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ if the highest exponents of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ is same.\nOn the other hand, if the highesting exponents of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ is different, it will attach the higher one.\nWe can see that how the while loop end is when one of the $f(x)$ is completely attached to new matrix.\nTherefore, the total execute time will depends on the amounts of terms in $D(x)$ ($D(x) = a(x) + b(x)$) which $\\ge max(smallest_{exponent}a(x) , smallest_{exponent}b(x))$\nThe remaining terms will be execute after the while loop.\nFor example :\nif $a(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ , $b(x) = 3x^3 + 3x^2 + 3$ then the $max(smallest_{exponent}a(x) , smallest_{exponent}b(x))$ will be $1$ since the smallest exponent of $a(x) = 1$ , $b(x) = 0$\nAccording to my conclusion above, the total execute time will be the amounts of exponents which $\\ge 1$ The amounts of exponents which $\\ge 1$ is $3$\nQuestion 2 (a) #\rQuestion 2 (b) #\rQuestion 2(c) #\rInitially, row_begin is set to be 1.

Since there are four columns in B which has nonzero elements.\nIf the matrix A is a m * n matrix and matrix B is a n * k matrix, how many times of the instruction “i = row_begin;” is executed?\nSince the question does not imply \u0026ldquo;Before row_begin in assigned a new value\u0026rdquo;, therefore, the answer = numbers of rows in A which has nonzero element * number of cols in B which has nonzero element. Therefore, the answer will be range from $0$ ~ $m*k$.\nQuestion 2(d) #\rHow many times of the instruction “row_begin = i;” is executed for the given example?\n4 times. Since there are four rows in A which has nonzero elements.\nIf the matrix A is a m * n matrix and matrix B is a n * k matrix, how many times of the instruction “row_begin= i;” is executed?\nThe number of rows in A which has nonzero elements.

Please find the maximum order for the big-Ω estimation. Please also provide the values of c and n0 satisfying the definition of the big-Ω estimation.\nAnswer : #\rAccording to the definition of Big-Ω ,if $f(x) \\geq c*g(x)$ , $f(x) = Ω(g(x))$ Since the question want maximum order , we can set the $g(x) = $ $2^n$ (It\u0026rsquo;s because that $2^n$ has the maxinum growth speed in $4n^3 + 8n^2 + 2^n$)\n$4n^3 + 8n^2 + 2^n$ $\\geq 2^n$ $= 4n^3/2^n + 8n^2/2^n + 1 \\geq c$ If we set $c = 1$ $n \u0026gt;= 0$ , $4n^3/2^n + 8n^2/2^n + 1 \\geq 1$ Therefore when $c = 1$ , $n0 = 1$ Question 3 : #\rPlease determine a succinct big-Θ expression for the growth of the function $log(n^2) + n^2log(n^4) +1000n^3 + 5000000n$. You don’t have to provide appropriate constants c1, c2, and n0 for the definition. However, please explain how to get your answer.\nAnswer : #\rAccording to the definition of Big-Θ ,while $c1g(x) \\geq f(x) \\geq c2g(x)$ , $f(x) = Θ(g(x))$ The professor had told us that we should observe the part which growth fastest in the function while we want to calculate the time complexity of a function $f(x)$, The given function $log(n^2) + n^2log(n^4) +1000n^3 + 5000000n$, we can see that the fastest growth part is $1000n^3$ Therefore, we can set the $g(x)$ to $n^3$\nSince we don\u0026rsquo;t have to provide appropriate constants $c1 , c2 , n0$ Therefore we can set the answer to $Θ(n^3)$,according that $n^3$ growth fastest in the function.

(Example : we imply $O(n^2)$ but not $O(5n^2)$)? (2) If there is a function $5n^3+4n+2$,Why we usually imply its time complexity as $O(n^3)$ but not $O(n ^3+n)$?\nAnswer #\r(1) The main reason is when we calculate the time complexity, while the n growth to a very large number, the coef will not affect the time complexity much. For example, if a function\u0026rsquo;s time complexity is $O(n^2)$ , it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter it is $5n^2$ or $n^2$ while n is large. On the other hand, the main goal when we imply the time complexity is to estimate the efficiency of a function, not the precious number. Therefore, while we are estimating Big-O notation, the important part is the growth speed, not the coef. (2) The main reason is the growth speed of $n^3$ is too fast. Therefore, while $n$ changes, $n^3$ grow too fast compared to other part of function. We can ignore the part of the function which grow slower since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the whole time speed a lot. There is an important knowledge between these two question, which we should focus on the time efficiency but not the precious number of the function when we are estimating the time complexity of an algorithm.\n","date":"22 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/homeworks/data_structure_hw1/","section":"","summary":"","title":"Data Structure Homework 1","type":"homeworks"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/side_projects/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"side_projects"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/gui/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"GUI","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mqtt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"MQTT","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pyqt/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PyQt","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/side-project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Side Project","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rTPTRS-MQTT #\rTPTRS-MQTT is a project written with PyQt5 and MQTT server, the final project of Data Science \u0026amp; Communication 2024 NTNU.
